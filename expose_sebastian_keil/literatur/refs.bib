   abstract = {The past quarter century has witnessed considerable advances in our understanding of Lightness (perceived reflectance), Brightness (perceived luminance) and perceived Transparency (LBT). This review poses eight major conceptual questions that have engaged researchers during this period, and considers to what extent they have been answered. The questions concern 1. the relationship between lightness, brightness and perceived non-uniform illumination, 2. the brain site for lightness and brightness perception, 3 the effects of context on lightness and brightness, 4. the relationship between brightness and contrast for simple patch-background stimuli, 5. brightness " filling-in", 6. lightness anchoring, 7. the conditions for perceptual transparency, and 8. the perceptual representation of transparency. The discussion of progress on major conceptual questions inevitably requires an evaluation of which approaches to LBT are likely and which are unlikely to bear fruit in the long term, and which issues remain unresolved. It is concluded that the most promising developments in LBT are (a) models of brightness coding based on multi-scale filtering combined with contrast normalization, (b) the idea that the visual system decomposes the image into " layers" of reflectance, illumination and transparency, (c) that an understanding of image statistics is important to an understanding of lightness errors, (d) Whittle's log. W metric for contrast-brightness, (e) the idea that " filling-in" is mediated by low spatial frequencies rather than neural spreading, and (f) that there exist multiple cues for identifying non-uniform illumination and transparency. Unresolved issues include how relative lightness values are anchored to produce absolute lightness values, and the perceptual representation of transparency. Bridging the gap between multi-scale filtering and layer decomposition approaches to LBT is a major task for future research. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The DOG model (and isotropic contrast models in general) cannot, however, account for another important group of brightness effects which includes the White effect (White (1979) Perception, 8, 413-416) and the demonstrations of Todorovic ((1997) Perception, 26, 379-395). This paper introduces an oriented DOG (ODOG) model which differs from the DOG model in that the filters are anisotropic and their outputs are pooled nonlinearly. The ODOG model qualitatively predicts the appearance of the test patches in the White effect, the Todorovic demonstration, GI and SBC, while quantitatively predicting the relative magnitudes of these brightness effects as measured psychophysically using brightness matching. The model also accounts for both the smooth transition in test patch brightness seen in the White effect (White & White (1985) Vision Research, 25, 1331-1335) when the relative phase of the test patch is varied relative to the inducing grating, and for the spatial variation of brightness across the test patch as measured using point-by-point brightness matching. Finally, the model predicts intensive aspects of brightness induction measured in a series of Todorovic stimuli as the arms of the test crosses are lengthened (Pessoa, Baratoff, Neumann & Todorokov (1998) In6estigati6e Ophthalmol-ogy and Visual Science, Supplement, 39, S159), but fails in one condition. Although it is concluded that higher-level perceptual grouping factors may play a role in determining brightness in this instance, in general the psychophysical results and ODOG modeling argue strongly that the induced brightness phenomena of SBC, GI, the White effect and the Todorovic demonstration, primarily reflect early-stage cortical filtering operations in the visual system.},

@article{Blakeslee2005,
   abstract = {The White effect [Perception 8 (1979) 413] cannot be simply explained as due to either brightness contrast or brightness assimilation because the direction of the induced brightness change does not correlate with the amount of black or white border in contact with the gray test patch. This has led some investigators to abandon spatial filtering explanations not only for the White effect but for brightness perception in general. Offered instead are explanations based on a variety of junction analyses and/or perceptual organization schemes which in the case of the White effect are usually based on T-junctions. Recently, Howe [Perception 30 (2001) 1023] challenged T-junction based explanations with a novel variation of White's effect in which the T-junctions were constant while the brightness effect was eliminated or reversed, and proposed an alternative explanation in terms of illusory contours. The present study argues that an analysis at the level of illusory contours is not necessary and that a much simpler spatial filtering based explanation is sufficient. Brightness induction was measured in a set of stimuli chosen to illustrate the relationship between the Howe stimulus [Perception 30 (2001) 1023], the White stimulus [Perception 8 (1979) 413] and the classical simultaneous brightness contrast (SBC) stimulus. The White stimulus and the SBC stimulus occupy opposite ends of a continuum of stimuli in which the Howe stimulus is the mid-point. The psychophysical measurements were compared with the predictions of the oriented difference-of-Gaussians (ODOG) computational model of Blakeslee and McCourt [Vision Research 39 (1999) 4361]. The ODOG model parsimoniously accounted for both the direction and relative magnitude of the brightness effects suggesting that more complex mechanisms are not required to explain them.

@article{Betz2015,
   abstract = {Spatial filtering models are currently a widely accepted mechanistic account of human lightness perception. Their popularity can be ascribed to two reasons: They correctly predict how human observers perceive a variety of lightness illusions, and the processing steps involved in the models bear an apparent resemblance with known physiological mechanisms at early stages of visual processing. Here, we tested the adequacy of these models by probing their response to stimuli that have been modified by adding narrowband noise. Psychophysically, it has been shown that noise in the range of one to five cycles per degree (cpd) can drastically reduce the strength of some lightness phenomena, while noise outside this range has little or no effect on perceived lightness. Choosing White's illusion (White, 1979) as a test case, we replicated and extended the psychophysical results, and found that none of the spatial filtering models tested was able to reproduce the spatial frequency specific effect of narrowband noise. We discuss the reasons for failure for each model individually, but we argue that the failure is indicative of the general inadequacy of this class of spatial filtering models. Given the present evidence we do not believe that spatial filtering models capture the mechanisms that are responsible for producing many of the lightness phenomena observed in human perception. Instead we think that our findings support the idea that low-level contributions to perceived lightness are primarily determined by the luminance contrast at surface boundaries.},

Lightness has long been a central research topic in experimental psychology, as perceiving surface color is an important visual task but also a difficult one due to the deep ambiguity of retinal images. In this article, I review psychophysical work on lightness perception in complex scenes over the past 20 years, with an emphasis on work that supports the development of computational models. I discuss Bayesian models, equivalent illumination models, multidimensional scaling, anchoring theory, spatial filtering models, natural scene statistics, and related work in computer vision. I review open topics in lightness perception that seem ready for progress, including the relationship between lightness and brightness, and developing more sophisticated computational models of lightness in complex scenes.},

Results were used to test the hypothesis that the two components of a complex grating may be detected independently. In an extensive experiment with f $=$ 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected only when f/f$\prime$$=$54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f$\prime$ lay outside this range. In other experiments, f was between 1.9 and 22.4 cycles/deg. All results are compatible with the assumption that the human visual system contains sensory channels, each selectively sensitive to different narrow ranges of spatial frequencies, whose outputs are detected independently.},

abstract = {This review summarizes recent work relevant to receptive field structure of cells of the parvocellular (PC) and (MC) magnocellular pathways in the primate. In the PC-pathway, recent data suggest that different color- and cone-opponent ganglion cells make up specific anatomical classes with specific cone connectivities and bipolar cell input. For example, blue-on ganglion cells have been identified anatomically as the small bistratified ganglion cell class. For the midget ganglion cells, which appear to be red-green opponent, there seems to be only one mosaic for red and green on-center and one for red and green off-center cells. This mixture of cell type within a retinal cell mosaic is unusual, as is the fact that dendritic trees of neighboring midget cells do not overlap. Physiologically, all PC-cells lack a contrast gain control mechanism and show a high degree of spatial and temporal linearity of their responses. In the magnocellular pathway, on- and off-center cells, corresponding to parasol cells with dendritic trees ramifying in the inner and outer sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer, show properties familiar from studies of cat ganglion cells, e.g. a contrast gain control is present. However, a chromatic input to the receptive field surround gives their responses an additional order of complexity.}
